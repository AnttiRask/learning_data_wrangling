# Learning data wrangling

I'm learning _data wrangling_ by reading the book __Data Wrangling with R__ by __Gustavo R. Santos__.

The idea of this repo is to collect the code for the book. So why even have my own version of the code for something that is [already available](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Data-Wrangling-with-R)?

1. __Learning:__ I learn the best when I make the code 'my own'.
2. __tidyverse:__ And the R dialect I like the best is {tidyverse}. Nothing against base R or data.table, but I prefer the tidy syntax. And I've gone through the code thinking is there a way I could rewrite this using tidyverse-related packages and functions.
3. __Readability:__ I strive to follow the tidyverse style guide. I'm sure I don't always succeed, but I try to modify the code to be easier to read. Whether it's adding comments or using the pipe (%>%) instead of nested functions.
4. __Helping others:__ It's a clich√©, but if even one person reads this and finds even parts of it useful, I'm happy.

## Disclaimer!
This repo is not meant to replace the book in any way. You should definitely read the book. It will help you understand data wrangling in general much better than just looking at the code or playing with it.

Also, I would recommend you buy the book. Here's a direct [link](https://www.packtpub.com/product/data-wrangling-with-r/9781803235400) to __Packt__'s (the publisher) website.
